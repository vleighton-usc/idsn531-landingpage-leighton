<!--Dear Professor Spurlock,

Maybe this all looks very simple for someone who works in Web Production. 
I really am trying to go back to basics. It feels like I can fluently understand and 
read a language, but I can't write it myself. Hopefully my CSS suffices for this particular
assignment! I'll see how I can take it to the next level in the next one. :)-->

        You're probably wondering what the point of this page is. Well, I'm going back to the basics of HTML and CSS! You see, in Website Production I'm more focused on Content Authoring, which involves a lot of <i>understanding</i> HTML and CSS but not necessarily writing it myself.</i>
        Believe it or not, I used to be pretty good at writing HTML and CSS from scratch but now I feel like I've totally lost my knowledge. <br/>
    <br/> I know this page is really ugly right now, and not a e s t h e t i c. But I will get there! I promise I'm actually pretty good at web design!</p>

This is my Corgi. I just got him and his name is Pancake. He is about 11 weeks old, and he is the love of my life. I did not know I would be getting a Corgi right now, but I have no regrets.
